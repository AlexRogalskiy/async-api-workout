== AsyncAPI workout

In this project I have experimented around using asyncAPI to create a define a definition nd then generate code from https://github.com/asyncapi/java-spring-template[java-spring-template]

I have a simple Async API definition with just one topic/queue. The producer publishes to this queue/topic, and the subscriber reads messages from it.

To generate code, you have to in the generator utility from https://github.com/asyncapi/generator[here].
Then you can run the command
```
ag asyncapi.yml \
@asyncapi/java-spring-template \
-p javaPackage=com.amrut.prabhu.consumer \
-p inverseOperations=false \
--force-write  \
-o async-kafka-consumer
```

This will generate the API user/consumer's application code.

you can generate the API provider's code using the following command
```
ag asyncapi.yml \
@asyncapi/java-spring-template \
-p javaPackage=com.amrut.prabhu.producer \
-p inverseOperations=true \
--force-write  \
-o async-kafka-producer
```
